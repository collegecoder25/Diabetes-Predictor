# Diabetes-Predictor
With the increase in number of cases of diabetic patients this Machine Learning Implementation will help a person knowing whether he/she is diabetic or not.
This is Machine Learning Implemented in the form of a Web App where it uses deep learning to predict whether a person is diabetic or not
In order to use the Web App you need to clone the model save file, and the Web_Deploy.py file and use the line 
streamlit -run "PATH TO DEPLOY_FILE/Web_deploy.py" .
The Web Deploy file itself uses several python libraries like :

1. Streamlit
2. Pickle
3. Numpy
4. Pickle

The model was trained using deeplearning which used several more python libraries like :

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Sklearn
4. Tensorflow
5. Keras
6. Seaborn

Make sure these libraries are pre-installed in the system before you try to run it.
